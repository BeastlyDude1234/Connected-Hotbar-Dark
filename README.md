## Compatibility

⚠️ **I am working on an update for the most recent versions.** Microsoft changed something in the newest versions that makes this one incompatible.

This resource pack will work with 1.20 and should work with _most_ versions prior to 1.20. Just ignore the incompatibility warning in the resource pack selection menu.
